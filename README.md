# tea_cozy
### *A project made as part of my Codecademy learning*
In this project, I was tasked with creating a fictional tea shop website on my own computer.

I was provided with a design spec and image assets to help me. 
Doing this has given me some first hand experience of what it will be like to work from a spec provided by a designer and how to approach it as a web developer.
The main focus of this project was to bolster my knowledge of **Flexbox**; from the parent elements (**flex containers**) to the child elements (**flex items**).

This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.
